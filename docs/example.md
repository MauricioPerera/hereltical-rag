# Machine Learning Guide

This is a comprehensive guide to machine learning fundamentals.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems improve their performance through experience.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.

### Classification

Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict categorical labels. Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

Examples of classification problems include spam detection, image recognition, and sentiment analysis.

### Regression

Regression predicts continuous numerical values. Linear regression is the simplest form, but more complex methods like polynomial regression and neural networks can model non-linear relationships.

Use cases include price prediction, weather forecasting, and stock market analysis.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data without predefined categories.

### Clustering

Clustering groups similar data points together. K-means is a popular algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity.

Applications include customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) reduce the number of features while preserving important information.

This is useful for visualization, noise reduction, and improving computational efficiency.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.

### Neural Networks

Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each connection has a weight that gets adjusted during training.

The basic architecture includes an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

CNNs are specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

CNNs have revolutionized computer vision tasks like object detection and image classification.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

RNNs are designed for sequential data. They maintain an internal state (memory) that allows them to process sequences of inputs.

Common applications include natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition.
